Summary
=======

This is a simple D program for reading in class list files and performing summary analyses on the data, including an output listing of Majors and Minors. I can't imagine that this is going to have wide appeal beyond use in the Guelph Geography department but I've placed it in this repository for archiving. Also note, the code is a mess!
